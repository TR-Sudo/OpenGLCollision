# OpenGLCollision

Graphics animation that demonstrates the use of the Boid's Algorithm to simulate the movement and behavior of a flock. The animation includes both diffuse, specular reflections to render the 3D objects and collision objects around the map. The animation shows how individuals within the group mimic the movement of their fellow members in order to achieve a shared objective as a team, while avoiding collisions within the map environment
